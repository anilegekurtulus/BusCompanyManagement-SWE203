# Bus Company Management System

## Course
SWE203 – Software Engineering

## Project Overview
This project is a console-based application developed in C#.
It was created to practice object-oriented analysis and design by modeling a real-world bus company system.

## Analysis and Design
During the analysis phase, the main real-world entities of a bus company were identified:
- Bus
- Driver
- Route

Based on this analysis, separate classes were designed for each entity.
A manager class named `BusCompany` was implemented to coordinate and manage these entities.

## Object-Oriented Design Decisions
- Encapsulation is achieved through properties.
- Association is implemented by storing buses, drivers, and routes in collections.
- Constructors are used to initialize objects with required data.
- Responsibilities are clearly separated between classes.

## System Structure
- Bus: Represents buses owned by the company.
- Driver: Represents drivers working for the company.
- Route: Represents routes operated by the company.
- BusCompany: Acts as the central management class.
- Program: Runs the application and demonstrates system usage.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a simple but effective object-oriented design.
The focus of the project is on analysis, class relationships, and clean design rather than complex user interfaces.
